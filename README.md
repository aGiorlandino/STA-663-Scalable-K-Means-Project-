STA 663: Statistical Computation Spring 2017


Project: Implementation of “Scalable K-means++”


Team members: Susan Cherry and Arpita Mandan


This is our final project for STA 663: Statistical Computation. We implemented the algorithm presented in “Scalable K-means++”. The code includes versions optimized with JIT and Cython and includes a parallel version. 

We also created an easily instable package for our functions. Examples and test code for the package are provided.
